          When you tap or insert your card, the visible part of the payment is over in seconds. Behind the
          scenes, back-office (BX) systems handle authorisation data, clearing files, settlement, fees and
          reconciliation. This page walks through that invisible layer.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Do We Mean by “BX” in Card Payments?</h2>
      <p>
        In many banks and payment providers, the shorthand “BX” or back-office refers to systems that sit
        behind the real-time authorisation layer. These platforms handle the life of a transaction once it
        has been approved: batching into clearing files, applying fees, accounting entries and ultimately
        paying money out to merchants and collecting from cardholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        While consumers mostly interact with the front-end – the card, the app, the terminal – the BX layer
        determines how quickly merchants are funded, how disputes are processed and how accurately fees and
        interest are calculated.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li><strong>Authorisation data</strong> is captured and stored for later matching.</li>
        <li><strong>Clearing messages</strong> turn a one-line approval into a settled transaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Posting engines</strong> update cardholder and merchant accounts.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Transaction lifecycle -->
    <section id="lifecycle" class="section">
      <h2>The Lifecycle of a Card Transaction in BX Systems</h2>
      <p>
        A typical card transaction passes through several stages after the initial “approved” message on the
        terminal. Each step may happen at different times and sometimes even on different days, depending on
        cut-off times and batch windows.
      </p>

      <div class="table-wrap mt-4">
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Stage</th>
              <th>What Happens</th>
              <th>Why It Matters</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Authorisation</td>
              <td>Issuer reserves funds and returns an approval code.</td>
              <td>Affects available balance and risk limits in real time.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Clearing</td>
              <td>Merchant’s acquirer submits clearing files through the network.</td>
              <td>Turns reserved amounts into actual transactions to be posted.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Settlement</td>
              <td>Net amounts are calculated between issuers, acquirers and networks.</td>
              <td>Determines when merchants get paid and when issuers owe funds.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Posting</td>
              <td>Transactions hit the cardholder’s account or statement.</td>
              <td>Drives interest calculations, minimum payments and limits.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p class="small mt-3">
        Delays or errors in these steps can show up as late postings, duplicate charges or temporary holds
        on a cardholder’s available balance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Fees & reporting -->
    <section id="fees" class="section">
      <h2>Fees, Interchange &amp; Reporting in the BX Layer</h2>
      <p>
        The back-office layer is also where the economics of card payments are applied. Interchange fees,
        scheme fees, acquirer margins and other charges are calculated and booked here, often based on
        information that comes from BIN data, merchant category codes and transaction geography.
      </p>
      <p>
        For merchants and issuers, BX systems produce the reports that show:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li><strong>Settlement summaries</strong> – how much will be paid out or collected on a given day.</li>
        <li><strong>Fee breakdowns</strong> – what portion of a transaction went to interchange, schemes and acquirers.</li>
        <li><strong>Chargebacks &amp; disputes</strong> – adjustments after the initial settlement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Well-designed BX setups give transparent, reconcilable views of all these flows. Poorly configured
        systems create reconciliation headaches and make it hard to understand real payment costs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- BX & modern products -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>BX Systems and Modern Card Products</h2>
      <p>
        As cards have evolved into digital-first products with virtual numbers, crypto links, instalments and
        flexible rewards, the back-office has had to adapt. New features often require new posting rules,
        additional ledger entries or separate product hierarchies, all implemented in BX platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-3">
        <li><strong>Installment plans</strong> created from a single purchase transaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Split postings</strong> where part of a transaction is treated as a fee, part as spend.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time statements</strong> in apps that still reconcile against an end-of-day ledger.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small mt-3">
        From the outside, this may look like a simple toggle in an app. Internally, it can mean substantial
        BX configuration and testing work.
